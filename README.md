# An Attendance and Bunk Managing App based on your TimeTable.

## Special thanks to the STCET Time Table  for confusing me xD

## HOW to use the APP?

1) Select the day you want to see the timetable of or want to plan a bunk.
2) Initially all the switches are turned on. So all the lectures are counted as attended. Turn off the switches that you are planning to bunk. 
3) Go to the Attendance Page. There you will be able to Checkout your attendance. Till The Selected Day on the first page.
4) For Example, If you want to check your attendance till Today, select Today's Date(It is selected by default when you open the app.) and then go to the Attendance Page. If you want to plan your attendance for future say upto  **X**, select that day, Turn off the switches you want to bunk between Initially Day(31st July, 2019) and then go to the Attendance Page.
5) Some Important pointers:
    * Initial Date is that of Sem Starting that is 31st July,2019.
    * End Date is that of Sem Ending that is XX/XX/XXXX.
    * You can set the attendance goal from settings tab by pressing the three dots on the top corner.
    * There are no lectures on weekend. So the App has been designed in that way. So ignore special days of attendance. 
    * This App will work for all branches.
    * This is app is in  Beta stage for now. However I haven't faced any bugs so far. If you face any, Report me on [Telegram](https://t.me/ayushd70).
6)TO DO: 
    * Attendance on Public Holidays to be marked by Red Colour.
    * Add Time Table for every Year/Deparment by default.
    * "DARK MODE"
